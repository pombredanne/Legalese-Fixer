# Legalese-Fixer
Program to edit legalese out of documents. Kind of like Hemingway, but for legal documents.

Features that I'd like the software to have:
1. Translator - If possible, just get access to an existing service. Otherwise, don't bother with it.

2. Spellcheck - More for those writing drafts, have a fairly robust spellchecker in place, so people can just write whatever they need to write on the software (instead of switching over to a word processor)

3. Legalese converter - To help with understanding legal documents, and to help create readable legal documents. By the time this is all finished, the application should both check for all legalese errors (but not edit them) and both check and fix the errors.
